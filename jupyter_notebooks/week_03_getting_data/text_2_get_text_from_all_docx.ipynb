       " 3: 'Data science is not just erupting in today’s world, but it has erupted since 1962 we just didn’t know the actual name of the work we were practicing. Things such as statistics, mathematics, and data analytics. Around 1970’s they started thinking about the amount of data that was being stored and how we can convert this data into information and knowledge. The knowledge of using customers preference on the products they buy was called database marketing which started in 1994. The first time that the word data science was used in IFCS at a conference in Japan. IFCS has already known about data analytics and data science publishing several books. There it was given variety of names from knowledge extraction to data pattern processing. As the name got bigger, professor in University of Michigan called statistics to be renamed data science and statisticians to be data scientists. Now that the names were changed people with statistics had to learn computing and data science had to look towards mathematics for both to comply together. In 2007 a research Center for Dataology and Data Science was established at Fudan University, China. In which they stated that it takes data in cyberspace as its project. In 2009 Google’s chief Economist, tells that it will be the sexiest job in the next ten year. Since we have so much data, the ability to understand, to process, to extract, to visualize, and to communicate will be very important to companies in the next decade. In June 2010 Mike Loukides writes what is data science. A data science is someone who can tackle all aspects of a problem, from data collection to drawing conclusions, and even testing accuracy to reach the best conclusion. In September 2010 Drew Conway writes the Data Science Venn diagram which includes data science being in the middle of Hacking Skills, Math and Statistics Knowledge, and Substantive Expertise. Overall the term data science came from many other terms, or simply for those who can use both data and science to create something new. '}"

       " 8: 'Lists are mutable, ordered, indexed, and heterogeneous. Technically, lists contain references to objects but, unless explicitly asked for, will always access the object itself but not the reference. Lists remind me of arrays of pointers that always access the object. Unlike strings, lists are mutable meaning they can be changed in place rather than creating a new object with every change. Because lists are ordered, they can be accessed by offset. Like strings, lists can be indexed and sliced. Lists are described as highly flexible and useful data types. ',\n",
       " 10: 'Dictionaries are described as similarly flexible and useful but with different characteristics. Dictionaries are sets of key-value pairs. Unlike lists, dictionaries are unordered collections of arbitrary objects. Like lists, dictionaries are variable length, heterogeneous, arbitrarily nest-able, and mutable. Unlike lists, dictionaries are accessed by key and are unordered which means that sequence operations cannot be performed on dictionaries. Each key in a dictionary can have only one value but this is not a one-to-one relationship; the same value may be assigned to multiple keys. Keys can be any immutable type but are often strings. ',\n",
       " 12: 'The chapter also discusses some important changes in how both lists and dictionaries are handled between Python 2 and 3. For example, lists of mixed type can no longer be sorted nor can magnitude comparisons in dictionaries be directly performed in Python 3. Several dictionary methods now return iterable view objects rather and lists but these objects can be forced to be lists if needed. The chapter does mention some reasons why one might choose a list over a dictionary (if order is important) or vice versa (a sparsely populated data structure or for named data where a key makes more sense than an offset). Both lists and dictionaries are powerful data types and have their various strengths.'}"

<p>Initially, “50 years of Data Science” talks about how Data Science initiatives have got started, an idea on what Data Science is and how it has grown in a vast way till date. Further, we can see the comparisons between Data Science and Statistics where the phenomenon of Data Science can seem puzzling to the statisticians. The statisticians feel so because the activities they were working on over centuries ago were dealing with data however it was, either big or small for hundreds of years has come into the limelight now which are performed by data scientists considering those to be new. The first comparison between Data Science and Statistics is that how “Big Data” has been given a lot of importance for all the fields of data Science for handling such data but Big Data can also be rejected as there are meaningful distinctions between statistics and data science and Statisticians have always been comfortable with large datasets over decades with scientific understanding on it. The next point is about how the data science trainees are having the skills needed to deal with such big datasets. But the new skills were not for solving the problems in a better way, instead it was to deal with the constraints on algorithms posed by the multiprocessor world. Additionally, according to Barlow, any advanced quantitative degree will be sufficient for the jobs offered by global IT enterprises whereas the DSI feels that traditional statistics degree is not enough to land in these jobs. The Framework in future will have the implications about how data science is done and improved over the decades.</p>

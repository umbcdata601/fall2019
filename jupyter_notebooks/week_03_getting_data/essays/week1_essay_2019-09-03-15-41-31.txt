<p>Data science is the termed coin which is being discussed by everyone. Data Science has become a fourth approach to scientific discovery. Universities feel the importance of Data Science and hence they introduced Data Sceince Intitative (DSI) by funding it 100 million dollars along with 35 new faculty jobs. DSI websites states that Data Science is &quot;Scientific discoery and practice involves analysing, managing, computing of vast amount of heterogeneous data&quot;. On the other hand statisticians feel that every defination that applies to data science also applies to statistics. They rose debates stating that Data Science is just another fancy word for statistics or informatics. But people from information technology background feel that Data Science is more than just calculating math, statistics is just a part of Data Science. Data Science or Big Data deals with analysing or predicting information which is coming from large amount of data and they feel that statistics has only been dealing with small amount of data since long time and computer scientists have settled on things like data scientists have skills which are needed to cope with big datasets. A good data science should not limit his\her knowledge to only analysing but also should be able to write up some codes. Data Sceicne has become popluar in times and will become more popular in next 50 years giving us the oportunity to learn from science as a body.</p>

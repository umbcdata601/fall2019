DataScience vs Statistics?
Data Science, in layman terms talks about the collection, management, processing of large data. So, this paper mainly talks about how different is Data Science from Statistics and the reasons behind it. Initially, the paper talks about the basic definition of Data Science which baffles the Statisticians. The definition of Data Science is about evaluating the data through scientific methods whereas the definition of Statistics is about the science of collecting and analyzing the data in large quantities. Further, the article talks about various ways through which they might be differentiated. First, Bigdata, where it cannot be used as criteria because the statistics were initially used for larger data from the last 200 years. Secondly, the skills. Initially, the argument is about how larger data cannot be analyzed through traditional means. Then, the argument ends talking about how modern skills are not for solving problems but for organizational aspects. Finally, it talks about jobs. At the end of the argument, the skills of a Data Scientist come from experience and whether to use computer systems for the problem. At the end of the day, the paper talks about Data Science which is touted today isn’t a notable change. The trends used today in the name of Data Science are more of a commercial than the thought-provoking trend. It ends with the hope of new developments which might change the “now” definition of Data Science.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;line-height: 107.0%;color: black;">Initially, statisticians were interested in deducing relevant information from large sets of generalized information. As they watched the field of mathematical statistics evolve, they inferred that their interest was in Data Analysis. While surveying the contemporary data processing methods that were used, data was defined as  representation of facts or ideas in a way that is capable of being conveyed or manipulated by some process. In 1977, an association was established with a mission to link traditional statistical methods, computer technology and domain knowledge  to extract knowledge and information from data. In  1994, an era of Data Marketing commenced wherein companies  gathered information and kept track on the buying patterns of customers so that they could place those products together to increase the sales. KDD(Knowledge Discovery in Database) is a process which includes all steps from data gathering, selection , cleaning,  mining to interpreting patterns so as to gather useful knowledge from data. To work with tons of data, it was imperative for statisticians to have  computational knowledge, thereby a combination  of both Statistics and Computer Science  field was needed and hence new field  known as Data Science came into existence. Journal of Data Science defined Data Science as anything related to data collection, analysis and visualisation leading to fact-based decision making. Data Scientist is considered to be the most coveted job title in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. This is because of the fact that they are responsible for collection of data, applying statistical and machine learning algorithms and then interpreting, communicating and visualizing the results. Also, they have the luxury of thinking beyond the set norms. </span></p>

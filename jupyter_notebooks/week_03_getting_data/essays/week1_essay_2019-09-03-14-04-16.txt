Recently, many new initiatives have been started. In Turkey centennial the presentations are applied statisticians and choose their professional career a long process. To statisticians the DSI phenomenon can seem puzzling. Data scientist means a professional who uses scientific methods to liberate and create meaning from raw data whereas ‘statistics’ means the practice or science of collecting and analyzing numerical data in large quantities. They recognized certain recurring ‘Memes’. It was stated as ‘A Better Framework’. Over the last 50years, developing data analysis by using the environment of early statistical packages which had roots in the mainframe computing. But in recent years’ new environment is used for minicomputer. Biermann says that user’s data is divided into two cultures namely ‘Generative Modeling’ and ‘Predictive Modeling’. The Predictive culture is called as the Common Task Framework. CTF research paradigm derives an ultimate success for many automatic applications. The heart of this method is information technology skills. Python and machine learning are the main tools for the Data Analysis. GDS Research has a high impact and interesting facts. They are methods like Wide-meta Analysis, Cross-study analysis, Cross-Workflow Analysis. In upcoming 50 years the open science takes place and overcome the complexity facing for data exaction. By using the above mentioned methods we can test the data empirically in future. GDS proposes technology to analysis in evidence-based manner. </span></p>

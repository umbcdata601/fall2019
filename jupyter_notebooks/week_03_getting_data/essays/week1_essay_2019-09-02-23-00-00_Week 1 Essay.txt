Week 1, Reading and Essay 
In "50 years of Data Science", David Donoho provides a perspective on where “data science” fits among existing sciences. He describes confusion about what "data science" truly involves and how it differs from statistics. The outlines the three major "memes" that are used to describe the new field of data science and why it is important today. The first is the 'Big Data' Meme, where data science is described as uniquely capable of analyzing the quantity of data generated in the modern world. He rejects this outright, arguing that statisticians are the original "big data analysts", and that statistics was born from a need to describe and understand big sets of data, e.g. census data. The second "meme" is "Skills", which argues that data scientist must have the skills to navigate the current computational environments used for storing and computing large data sets. Donoho argues that even the application of these computer science skills can interfere with the most effective methods of analysis. The third "meme" is Jobs, wherein data science only exists as a field that can be learned on a job; the skills needed are so unique that no college program will prepare students adequately.   
To contrast with these “memes”, Donoho outlines the development of data science as a unique scientific field. This field would be concerned with learning from data, encompassing every aspect of this endeavor. John Tukey predicted the development of a scientific field of data analysis in 1962, and his predictions have proven accurate. Mr. Donoho argues data science is its own field of science, as complex as any other.

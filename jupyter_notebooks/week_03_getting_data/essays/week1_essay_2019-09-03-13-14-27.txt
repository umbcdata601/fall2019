<p>Data Science has appeared in various contexts over the past fifty years but did not become an established term until recently. In an early usage, it was used as a substitute for computer science. In 1968 Peter Naur firstly introduced the term &quot;datalogy&quot; and later he published a book, which freely used the term data science. Later many of the scientists, statisticians, librarians, computer scientists discussed and also published books about data mining, data analytics and databases. In 2001 William S. Cleveland published a book about technical areas of the field of Statistics and his intention is to bring asubstantial change which is related to data processing, the altered field will be called data science. In subsequent years there is an lot of active research and reports goingin the field of data science. In 2008 The JISC publishes the final report of a study on the role and career development of data science and data scientists and the associated supply of specialist data curation skills required for research. Later in following years everyone predicted that, there will be lot of demand for data scientist as he has the abilityto take data—to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it. So, as of now data science is the most demanding and booming field which helps in a lot of problem solving.</p>

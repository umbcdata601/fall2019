<p class="p1">The website for DSI which was announced by University of Michigan gives an idea “What is Data Science “.To statisticians, the DSI phenomenon can seem puzzling.”Data Scientists” means a professional who uses data scientific methods to liberate and create meaning from raw data.To statisticians, this sounds an awful where<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Statistician” means the practice or science of collecting and analysing numerical data in large quantities.After identifying many forces in new science,Data Science can gain much from formal statistics. In 1993, Chambers, co-developer of the S language for statistics and data analysis published the essay provocatively titled “Greater or Lesser Statistics, A choice for Future Research”. By considering the Data Science programs at some of the universities that have recently established, Tukey, Chambers, Cleveland and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Breiman came to know that Data Science Masters curricula are compromised taking some material out of a Statistics masters program to make room for large database training. Chambers and Cleveland classified the collection of activities mentioned till now as Greater Data Science and Lower Data Science.By considering the so far evidences some researchers found out clues about the next 50 years of Data Science.From 2006 to 2014, the authors took fundamental steps and concluded that Data Science in future(2065) will be validated empirically.Finally, each proposed notion of Data Science involves some enlargement of academic statistics and machine learning. GDS proposes that Data Science is the science of learning from data, and inherently works to understand the validity of the conclusions produced by university research and can play key role in all campuses.</p>

Before 1974 the term Data Science was being used very vaguely, so Naur defined it as “The science of dealing with data”. In 1994 companies started collecting information about customers and started making marketing strategies. Previously finding useful patterns from data was given many names like data mining, information harvesting etc but in 1996 Fayyad and two others wrote that Knowledge Discovery in Database refers to finding useful knowledge from data and data mining is a particular step in this process. The conventional statistical methods worked well with smaller data sets whereas modern databases have tons of data, hence new method need to be developed which meant combining fields of statistics and computers. So in 2001 Cleveland suggested that a data scientist should develop both statistical and computing knowledge. By the end of 2003 the term Data Science acquired a new definition, it was considered as anything that has something to do with data such as collecting, cleaning, modeling and visualizing. By 2005, companies started competing based on Quantitative analytics and predictive tools rather than traditional factors to improve their economy. In 2009 according to a chief economist the ability to understand data, process it, extract value from it, visualize it and communicate are skills which are very important in the next few decades and demand for people with these skills increased tremendously. In 2012 D.J Patil and Tom Davenport published an article in Harvard Business Review stating Data Science to be the sexiest job of 21st century.</span></p>

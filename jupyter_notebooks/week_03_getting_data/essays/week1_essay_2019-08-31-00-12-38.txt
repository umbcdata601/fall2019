From the time of the 16th century when astrologer Tycho Brahe collected huge data sets about the planetary motion, which later played a crucial role in the Kelper’s discovery of elliptical planetary motion.</span></b></p>

From the 19th century, many scholars worked on emphasizing the importance of data and defining the term Data Science. In the 19th century many renowned names like John W. Tukey, Claude Shannon have worked on how to turn data into information and knowledge. Many organizations like BusinessWeek, International Federation of Classification Societies (IFCS) have published about the Data Science that leads to the expansion of the Field. On September 2012 Tom Davenport and D.J. Patil published “Data Scientist” as Sexiest Job of the 21st century in the Harvard Business Review. Data Science is a fast emerging and continuously growing field and with all new technology and stuff, it will continue to provide solutions to the complex business problems and help them grow.</span></b></p>

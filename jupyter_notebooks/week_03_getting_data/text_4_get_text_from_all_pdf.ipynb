       "'DATA 601\\n\\nSept 6, 2018\\n\\nAssignment 1\\n\\nArticle Summary\\n\\nIn A Very Short History of Data Science, Gil Press presents to us a \\n\\n\\t\\ncomprehensive timeline of the evolution of the interdisciplinary ﬁeld of data science — \\nthe product of the coupling of the age-old discipline of statistics with a relatively new \\none — computer science. Press dates the conception of data science to 1962 when \\nJohn W. Tukey   wrote in The Future of Data Analysis that “data analysis is intrinsically \\nan empirical science.” Readers are then introduced to various seminal works that \\nhelped to engender the birth of data science since then. Through reviewing an array of \\nscholarly endeavors in this new ﬁeld, Press shows us that data science emerges \\namidst the ambivalence and questioning by traditional statistics, even though the \\nstatistician, Dr. C.F. Jeﬀ Wu once advocated renaming statistics as data science and \\nstatisticians as data scientists in 1997. Perhaps, the clear demarkation of the entrance \\nof Data Science into the limelight of professional discourse was in 2001 when William \\nS. Cleveland published Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas \\nof the Field of Statistics. The ensuing decade saw the rapid development of data \\nscience as its boundaries and frontiers expanded, gaining public attention and interest, \\nand ultimately leading to the publication of Data Scientist: The Sexist Job of the 21st \\nCentury in the Harvard Business Review in 2012.\\n\\n\\nReferences: Press, Gil, A Short History of Data Science, Forbes Magazine,  28 May 2013.\\n\\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/05/28/a-very-short-history-of-data-science/#32c00bac55cf  \\n— Accessed Sept 6, 2018\\n\\n\\x0c'"
